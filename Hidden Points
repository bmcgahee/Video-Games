//Title: Hidden Points
//Date: 3/15/2016
//Language: QBASIC
//Purpose:  This is a 1 player 2D game where you navigate a vessel (green circle) to find the center points of hidden circles.  
//Each point you find will indicate a beep sound and you earn points.  The green circle runs on limited fuel, so you will have
//to visit the fuel station to refuel the vessel.  The object of the game is to get 5,000 points before your fuel runs out.  

//Declaring all the game variables.
